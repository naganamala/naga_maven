8. In Maven, what do you mean by Clean, Default, and Site?
The three built-in build life cycles are:

Clean: The clean lifecycle is in charge of project cleaning.
Default: The project deployment is handled by the default lifecycle.
Site: The creation of the project's site documentation is referred to as the site lifecycle.
9. What are the different phases of the default life cycle?
The different phases of the default lifecycle are:

Validate: Make sure the project is correct and that you have all of the necessary information.
Test: Test the compiled source code using an appropriate unit testing framework. These tests should not demand that the code be packed or deployed; instead, take the compiled code and package it in a manner that can be distributed, such as a JAR.
Compile: Compile the project's source code.
Verify: Perform any necessary checks on integration test findings to ensure that quality criteria are met.
Install: Adds the package to the local repository, allowing it to be used as a dependency in other projects.
Deploy: Copies the entire package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and organizations, and is done in the build environment.

Maven plugins are divided into two categories:

Build plugins:  These plugins are used throughout the build process and are configured in the pom.xml file's <build/> element.
Reporting plugins: These plugins are configured in the pom.xml's <reporting/> element and run during stage generation.
